## Clone Repository

The following repository contains submodule(s). Clone the repo using the following command.
```
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/prakharg24/object_detection.git
```

Alternatively, first clone the repo, and then initialize every submodule seperately
```
git clone https://github.com/prakharg24/object_detection.git
git submodule update --init --recursive <submodule1_name>
git submodule update --init --recursive <submodule2_name>
...
```

## Submodules

The work done here is solely possible due to the following repositories. I have cloned these repositories, cleaned them and created my own submodules, however the majority of code is from the original repo.

### [keras-frcnn](https://github.com/prakharg24/keras-frcnn)
* Keras implementation of Faster R-CNN for object detection
* Known issues with keras version >=2.2.2
* keras version==2.1.6 and tensorflow version==1.8.0 recommended for smooth working

## Problem Statement

The task is to create an object detection system which classifies the object and returns a set of bounding box coordinates. This repository includes experimentation with different publicly available pretrained pipelines and some modifications made by us on top of it.

The submodule setup and modifications done here are generalised for any object detection problem statement. The experimentation results are for the following [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SU5SE13_rRwHHRga0Kb86-D3wU91u7rp/view?usp=sharing). Find the exact problem statement for the same attached [here](https://github.com/prakharg24/object_detection/blob/master/Assignment.pdf).
