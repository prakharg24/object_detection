## Submodules

### [keras-frcnn](https://github.com/kbardool/keras-frcnn/tree/59e12699aea69fa9e15c7ec74694e43087d02240)
* Keras implementatiof of Faster R-CNN
* Known issues with keras version >=2.2.2
* keras version=2.1.6 and tensorflow version=1.8.0 recommended for smooth working

## Problem Statement

The task is to create an object detection system which classifies the object and returns a set of bounding box coordinates. The object labels in the dataset are : cow/dog. This repository includes experimentation with different publicly available pretrained pipelines and some modifications made by us on top of it.

Please find the exact problem statement attached [here](https://github.com/prakharg24/object_detection/blob/master/Assignment.pdf)
